## Abstract
Siamese-based trackers are renowned for their balance between speed and accuracy in object tracking. However, improving their performance on complex scenes often requires more than simple correlation matching. In this work, two efficient architectural innovations are introduced to enhance a classic Siamese tracker. First, a Self-Graph Attention (SGA) correlation network is constructed to capture richer dependencies between the template and search region, which is achieved by cascading self-attention and graph-attention. Second, a lightweight Dimensional Reduction (DR) prediction network is designed to smoothly reduce feature dimensions, which not only improves tracking speed but also significantly reduces the model's parameter count. Experiments on classical datasets OTB-100 and LaSOT demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed modules. Notably, our resulting tracker not only achieves higher precision than its baseline but does so with a more compact model and lower computational cost, validating our approach as an effective and efficient enhancement for Siamese-based tracking.
